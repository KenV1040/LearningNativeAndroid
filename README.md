# About this projet
This repo is to keep track of my progress learning native android development with Kotlin.

# Structure of repo
There are two folders here: Notes, CrashCourseToDoList.

Notes follows my journey through reading the developer documentation of Android. Learning the very basics and the foundation of how an android app functions.

The CrashCourseToDoList is an actual android app, and it is my progression through this crash course on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBWyXo-3JGQ). The purpose of me following this is to get a hands-on feel of the app development of Android before diving deep into every detail of an Android app.
